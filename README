hellogridview - Android practice excercise
Pito Salas - March 2011

This is an example Android application that I will be buildingh up, step by step. The idea
is to illustrate each stage of development as another git branch. I am not sure yet what the 
final program will be. At this point I think it will be some kind of a picture viewer. But we
we shall see.

Branch: Step 1 - 

Make the initial activity have a layotu with a few views. The second one is the interesting one,
it will be containing a grid of all the photographs. For now we just include it and give it a
background color so it can be seen.
