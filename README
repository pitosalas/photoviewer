hellogridview - Android practice excercise
Pito Salas - March 2011

This is an example Android application that I will be buildingh up, step by step. The idea
is to illustrate each stage of development as another git branch. I am not sure yet what the 
final program will be. At this point I think it will be some kind of a picture viewer. But we
we shall see.

Branch: Step3 - Displaying static images

Now we have added a set of images (see res/drawable) and a new class (see ImageAdapter.java.)

The images are hardwired as resources, and thus have resource ids (see for example R.drawable.img1). And they are loaded
statically into the GridView that is setup in main.java.
