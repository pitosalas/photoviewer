hellogridview - Android practice excercise
Pito Salas - March 2011

This is an example Android application that I will be buildingh up, step by step. The idea
is to illustrate each stage of development as another git branch. I am not sure yet what the 
final program will be. At this point I think it will be some kind of a picture viewer. But we
we shall see.

Branch: Master - the original one

In retrospect I should have called this one "Step0". Basically it is an out of the box
skeleton application that does nothing at all.
